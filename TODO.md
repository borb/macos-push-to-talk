# To Do:
 - Have a key combination to leave mic open constantly and another for back to hushed. Probably 3 keys like cmd + opt + up/down
 - Auto install dependencies. Bundle.
 - Run in background instead of leaving console "busy".
 - Have a proper configuration file for key to use and volume levels.
 - Build a proper GUI someday.
